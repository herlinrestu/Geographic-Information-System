Geospatial data is data which has terrestrial space data useful to know the description of the Earth. With this data we can expand on the existing terrestrial science. And provide location information.
Geospesial data itself is divided into two, namely:
Cultural? the results of human civilization that emerged as the boundary region
Physcal? data visible naked eye
While geospatial data are divided into two types, namely:
Vector data? The data in the form of points, lines, and polygons are usually used for designing the map. Vector data of its own memiki class a shapefile.
Sample images:


Raster data? the data in the form of a box or square form a certain space and tagged with color pictures.

Shapefile format which is widely used for storing vector data formats, and raster. The function of the Shapefile is used to store the data and calculate the geospatial data. Calculating data such as city, boundary lines, the State, and all data residing on geospatial data.
In measuring shapefile can use the Qgis. For Qgis myself we just simply open a vector data file then click database managemant conduct click back Db manager and then select the virtual layer and select the file that we will open. Then on general info will appear the data we want to know. Next kuta can also view the data by using python. For python must first mengisntall next phytonnya run python on CMD.



CONCLUSION
-Geospatial Data are divided into two i.e data cultural and physcal data
-There are 2 types of Geospatial Data, namely data vector and raster data
-Shapefile used for storing vector and raster data formats.
-to open the shapefile can use the Qgis or python.
